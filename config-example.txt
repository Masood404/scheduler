        Without configuring this file. the scheduler app will not run!

        Please take the time to change some of these variables, you will run into errors if you have not configured
        this file yet after trying to run the scheduler web app, probably it could be a configurations problem and please
        check the most updated README file on https://github.com/Masood404/scheduler,
        if you still run into problems please feel free to contact anyone whose contact details is in the README.
